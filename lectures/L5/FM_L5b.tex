\begin{frame}{What did we do last week?}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Depth is driven by mostly same factors as liquidity: adverse selection and inventory risk
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Although the effect is, in general, less obvious with order costs and imperfectly competitive dealers
		\end{itemize}
		\item Kyle model demonstrates how adverse selection can drive limited depth
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Call auction market where dealer has to cover the order imbalance
			\item Informed traders face a trade-off: trade more vs trade at better price
			\item see textbook for Kyle model with inventory risk.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Today}
	\textbf{Empirical estimation of liquidity}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Earlier we looked at how to estimate the spread, but without a theory for what drives it
		\item Today: talk about estimating drivers of the spread
		\item Furthermore:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Look at estimating price impact/depth
			\item Look at estimating proportion of informed trading
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%\section{Empirics of illiquidity}

%\begin{frame}{Introduction}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item What determines illiquidity?
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Chapter 2 discussed empirical measures of illiquidity
%			\item Chapters 3 and 4 developed some theories
%			\item Can we detect the relative importance of theoretical effects on the measures?
%		\end{itemize}
%		\item The end of chapter 3 discussed the various price impacts of transaction costs, informed trading, market maker risk aversion (figure 3.9)
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Chapter 4: greater price change when transaction is larger
%		\end{itemize}
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Measured price impact and the theories}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Parameters of interest:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\lambda$: price impact related to information
			\item $\beta$: price impact related to MM risk aversion
			\item $\gamma$: order-processing cost
		\end{itemize}
		\item Data:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Transaction prices $p_t$, net market order flow $q_t$, order sign $d_t$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{How to estimate?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Take GM model with order costs. There have:
		\begin{align*}
			p_t &= \mu_t + \gamma d_t
			\\
			\Rightarrow \varDelta p_t &= \mu_t - \mu_{t-1} + \gamma \varDelta d_t
		\end{align*}
		\pause
		\item Further,
		\begin{align*}
			\mu_t = \mu_{t-1} + \lambda q_t + \varepsilon_t
		\end{align*}
		order flow is informative; also let $\varepsilon_t$ include all other kinds of public news
		\item Then
		\begin{align*}
			\varDelta p_t &= \lambda q_t + \gamma \varDelta d_t + \varepsilon_t
		\end{align*}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\cite{glosten_estimating_1988}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\cite{glosten_estimating_1988}} estimate
		\begin{equation} \tag{5.7}
			\Delta p_t = \gamma_0 \Delta d_t+ \gamma_1 \Delta q_t + \lambda_0 d_t + \lambda_1 q_t + \epsilon_t
		\end{equation}
		jointly with trade directions $d_t$. 
		\item Accumulated order flow affects price level via $\lambda$, cyclical order flow gives $\gamma$ in the style of Roll's measure (2.15)
		\item On NYSE data from early 80s, they find $\gamma_1=\lambda_0=0$ and estimate $\gamma_0=.0465$, $\lambda_1=.0102$ for average stock in sample
		(so a $\$1000$ trade pays $\$56.7$ total in trading costs and permanently shifts the price by $\$10.2$)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Issues}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Apart from the usual concerns with old empirical papers...
		\begin{itemize}
			\item not much data (20 stocks, 800 transactions each)
			\item questionable specification (why have both $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$?)
			\item questionable estimation procedures
		\end{itemize}
		\item ...there is the issue of ignoring inventory costs.
		\item In the short run, the effect of MM risk aversion would be similar
		\begin{equation} \tag{5.14}
		\Delta p_t = \gamma \Delta d_t + (\lambda + \beta) q_t + \epsilon_t
		\end{equation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\lambda$ and $\beta$ are not separately identified.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[label=extending]{Including inventory costs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\cite{hasbrouck_trades_1988}}: order flow is auto-correlated, so part of the order is not `news' but only moves inventory
		\item \textbf{\cite{huang_components_1997}}: suggest
		\begin{equation}\tag{5.17}
		q_t = \phi q_{t-1} + \eta_t
		\end{equation}
		\item Then (5.14) is modified to \hyperlink{derivation}{\beamerbutton{Derivation}}
		\begin{equation} \tag{5.21}
		\Delta p_t = \gamma \Delta d_t + \lambda (q_t - \phi q_{t-1}) + \beta q_t + \epsilon_t
		\end{equation}
		\item They estimate the model for 20 major NYSE stocks: 
		\begin{align*}
			\phi &= -0.74	& \lambda &= 9.59\% S
			\\
			\beta &= 28.65\% S	& \gamma &= 61.76\% S
		\end{align*}
		%NOTE: negative phi makes sense with inventory costs
		\item Also: greater $\beta$ for larger transactions
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Including inventory costs (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\citet*{madhavan_why_1997}} find that $\lambda$ is higher in the morning, and $\gamma$ higher in the afternoon
		% more adverse selection in the morning; higher bargaining power for dealers at closing (traders want to unwind positions)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Morning trading reveals all the information accumulated during off-market hours. Evening trading driven by traders' desire to close open positions
			\item \textbf{\cite{bogousslavsky_should_2020}}: closing auctions account for $7.3\%$ of daily trading volume, but contribute nothing to price discovery. Closing prices deviate a lot from midquotes, but revert back quickly. Why? 
			\pause 
			Probably because traders rush to close their positions before EoD. But also in part because closing auctions are more closed and are of lower quality, see \textbf{\cite{hu_vestigial_2020}}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\cite{lyons_tests_1995}} had data on a FOREX dealer's inventory, and found $\beta$ very large
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Probably also because FX dealers really don't like to hold overnight positions
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Long-run impact}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Different dynamic approach: \textbf{\cite{hasbrouck_measuring_1991}} uses the long-run impact of an order $q_{t+1}$ on prices $p_{t+T}-p_t$ to identify the informational part of the trade
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The `impulse response' of prices to orders
			\item Opens door to richer time series analysis of transactions data
		\end{itemize}
		%NOTE: it seems that 1-2% are not volume effects, but just effects of trade sign
		\item Findings: short-run effect of a trade $\approx 2\%$ of the price
		\item long-run effect of a trade ($T=5$ trades is ``long enough'') $\approx 1\%$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item greater LR impact for stocks with lower capitalization
			\item related: \textbf{\cite{ellul_financial_2018}} find that stocks with lower analyst coverage are less liquid
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Depth impact}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\cite*{de_jong_price_1996}} do analysis similar to \cite{hasbrouck_measuring_1991} with data from Paris Bourse, and taking trade quantities into account
		\item Find that LR price impact is between $25\%$ and $115\%$ of the spread (depending on estimation method)
		\item Find that \structure{adverse selection costs} \alert{increase with trade size}...
		\begin{itemize}
			\item aligns with Kyle model
		\end{itemize}
		\item ...while the \alert{converse} is true for \structure{order processing costs}. Possible reasons:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item costs are per-transaction rather than per-unit
			\item large orders come from institutional traders that get better terms of trade? (However: Paris Bourse was a pure-LOB market, no dealers, so this is probably not the reason)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Probability of Informed Trading}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\citet*{easley_liquidity_1996}}: use GM-type model to estimate the prob. of informed trading
		\item On any given trading day, w.p. $\alpha$ there is some information event
		\begin{itemize}
			\item good or bad
			\item observed by informed traders, not by dealer
		\end{itemize}
		\item Within the day, \{informed traders, uninformed sellers, uninformed buyers\} arrive as Poisson process with intensity $\{\epsilon_i, \epsilon_s, \epsilon_b \}$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Probability of observing $n$ traders of a particular type over the trading day is
			\[
			e^{-\epsilon} \frac{\epsilon^n}{n!}
			\]
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Probability of Informed Trading}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data for the number of buys and sells allow for estimation of these parameters with \structure{maximum likelihood}
		\item \textbf{\citet*{easley_is_2002}} estimate the `probability of informed trading' associated with any given order
		\begin{equation} \tag{5.27}
		PIN = \frac{\alpha \epsilon_i}{\epsilon_b + \epsilon_s + \alpha \epsilon_i}
		\end{equation}
		\item In NYSE data from 1983 to 1998:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item median PIN $=19\%$
			\item for $90\%$ of stocks, PIN is between $10\%$ and $30\%$
			\item greater for small-cap stocks, positively correlated with spread and price volatility
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\citet*{grammig_knowing_2001}} show that PIN is higher when markets are more anonymous
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	Using the insights from previous lectures we can estimate the importance of different components of the spread
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Perhaps surprisingly, order costs are by far the largest cost (but estimated on major stocks)
		\item Adverse selection is a smaller, yet significant factor 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item is more of an issue in small-cap stocks
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Homework}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Read the Economist article on the corporate bond market. Discuss the following questions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How does corporate bond market liquidity differ from the stock market liquidity? Why?
		\item Why do investors' liquidity expectations matter?
		\item How do investors form their expectations of liquidity?
		\item Can we \emph{measure investors' expectations} of liquidity?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Next week}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyze limit order markets: what is the difference to what we have done so far?
	\item Talk about the role of the `ticks', the priority rule, the interaction between dealers and LOBs, and a way to interpret limit orders
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=derivation, noframenumbering]{Derivation of (5.21)}
	Suppose $q_t=\phi q_{t-1}+\eta_{t}$. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Adverse selection.} Notice that value equation is now
		\[
		\mu_t=\mu_{t-1}+\lambda[q_t-\mathbb{E}[q_t|\Omega_{t-1}]]+\epsilon_t.
		\]
		Only non-expected part of order flow carries information. 
		\item \textbf{Price.} The price equation then becomes
		\[
		p_t=m_t+\beta q_t+\lambda[q_t-\mathbb{E}[q_t|\Omega_{t-1}]]+\gamma d_t,
		\]
		where $m_t=\mu_t-\beta z_t$ is the `mid-price' from the Stoll model 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[noframenumbering]{Derivation of (5.21)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use $q_t=\phi q_{t-1}+\eta_{t}$ to get $\mathbb{E}[q_t|\Omega_{t-1}]=\phi q_{t-1}$.
		\item Take first differences of price equation
		\[
		\Delta p_t = \Delta m_t + \lambda [ \Delta q_t-\phi\Delta q_{t-1}]+\beta \Delta q_t+\gamma \Delta d_t
		\]
		\item Notice that $\Delta z_t=-q_{t-1}$ from market clearing condition. Then
		\[
		\Delta m_t = \Delta \mu_t-\beta \Delta z_t = (\lambda+\beta)q_{t-1}-\lambda \phi q_{t-2}+\epsilon_t.
		\]
		\item Substitute in to get
		\[
		\Delta p_t =(\lambda+\beta)q_{t-1} - \lambda\phi  q_{t-1}+\gamma \Delta d_t+\epsilon_t.
