We show that illiquid assets can have lower expected returns if the short-sellers have more wealth, lower risk aversion, or shorter horizon. The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for positive-net-supply assets, and depends on investors' net nontraded risk exposure. We estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We find strong evidence for an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller. The effect of liquidity risk is significant but economically small.},

	abstract = {This paper solves explicitly a simple equilibrium model with liquidity risk. In our liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity.},

The central tradeoff in these algorithms is between the desire to trade and transaction costs. Large parent orders generate hundreds of child orders which strategically employ the price, time, and display priority rules embodied in market structure to navigate this tradeoff. The distribution of child orders is non-random, generating strategic runs which oscillate between providing and taking liquidity. Price impact occurs both at the time an order is submitted to the book (regardless of whether it is filled), and at the time of execution. Passive child orders have much lower likelihood of execution but still incur substantial price impact. Conversely, marketable orders, even though immediately executable, do not necessarily guarantee execution and generate even larger price impact.},

They also enable fast traders to obtain information before slow traders, generating adverse selection, and thus negative externalities.

Completely banning fast trading is dominated by offering two types of markets: one accepting fast traders, the other banning them. Utilitarian welfare is maximized with (i) a single market type on which fast and slow traders coexist and (ii) Pigovian taxes on investment in the fast trading technology.},
