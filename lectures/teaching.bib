We show that illiquid assets can have lower expected returns if the short-sellers have more wealth, lower risk aversion, or shorter horizon. The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for positive-net-supply assets, and depends on investors' net nontraded risk exposure. We estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We find strong evidence for an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller. The effect of liquidity risk is significant but economically small.},

In our liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity.},

The distribution of child orders is non-random, generating strategic runs which oscillate between providing and taking liquidity. Price impact occurs both at the time an order is submitted to the book (regardless of whether it is filled), and at the time of execution. Passive child orders have much lower likelihood of execution but still incur substantial price impact. Conversely, marketable orders, even though immediately executable, do not necessarily guarantee execution and generate even larger price impact.},

First, we use the Glosten (1994) model for an electronic order-driven market. In line with theoretical predictions, the price impact increases with trade size, and is estimated between 25\% (for small transactions) and 60\% (for large transactions) of the total spread. We then use a reduced form approach based on a multi-period Vector Auto Regression. The VAR estimates of the permanent price impact are between 40\% and 115\% of the spread, much larger than the estimates of Glosten's one-period model. We check the robustness of these results by less restrictive, direct estimates of long-run price effects and confirm the results of the VAR analysis. We separately analyze the price effects of off-exchange transactions. These appear to have no long run price impact at all. In all results, there is no reversal of the direction of trade, which suggests that inventory control is unlikely to be important on the Paris Bourse.},

	abstract = {We develop a model of dynamic limit order markets under asymmetric information that can be simplified enough to be solved analytically. We find that informed traders tend to {\textquotedblleft}make{\textquotedblright} liquidity in illiquid markets and {\textquotedblleft}take{\textquotedblright} liquidity from more liquid markets. Time between arrivals of limit or market orders conveys information, resulting in repricing of orders in the book and generating the frequent cancellations and resubmissions that have become a staple of modern markets. A novel methodological contribution of our approach is its demonstration of the recursive nature of time-to-execution of limit orders that can be used to characterize equilibrium prices.},

	abstract = {We find that Robinhood ownership changes are unrelated with future returns, suggesting that zero-commission investors behave as noise traders. We exploit Robinhood platform outages to identify the causal effects of commission-free traders on financial markets. Exogenous negative shocks to Robinhood participation are associated with increased market liquidity and lower return volatility among stocks favored by Robinhood investors, as proxied by Reddit WallStreetBets mentions. HFTs with Robinhood order flow arrangements quote narrower lit-market spreads during outages, and market depth order imbalances fall, particularly for stocks with highly autocorrelated order flow, suggesting that zero-commission investors create liquidity-reducing inventory risks for market makers.},
