We show that illiquid assets can have lower expected returns if the short-sellers have more wealth, lower risk aversion, or shorter horizon. The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for positive-net-supply assets, and depends on investors' net nontraded risk exposure. We estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We find strong evidence for an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller. The effect of liquidity risk is significant but economically small.},

In our liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices.

The distribution of child orders is non-random, generating strategic runs which oscillate between providing and taking liquidity. Price impact occurs both at the time an order is submitted to the book (regardless of whether it is filled), and at the time of execution. Passive child orders have much lower likelihood of execution but still incur substantial price impact. Conversely, marketable orders, even though immediately executable, do not necessarily guarantee execution and generate even larger price impact.},

First, we use the Glosten (1994) model for an electronic order-driven market. In line with theoretical predictions, the price impact increases with trade size, and is estimated between 25\% (for small transactions) and 60\% (for large transactions) of the total spread. We then use a reduced form approach based on a multi-period Vector Auto Regression. The VAR estimates of the permanent price impact are between 40\% and 115\% of the spread, much larger than the estimates of Glosten's one-period model. We check the robustness of these results by less restrictive, direct estimates of long-run price effects and confirm the results of the VAR analysis. We separately analyze the price effects of off-exchange transactions. These appear to have no long run price impact at all. In all results, there is no reversal of the direction of trade, which suggests that inventory control is unlikely to be important on the Paris Bourse.},

Successfully identifying lithium as the fusion fuel using only publicly available financial data, the paper was seen as a threat to national security and was immediately confiscated and destroyed. The bomb's construction being secret at the time but having since been partially declassified, the nuclear tests of the early 1950s provide an opportunity to observe market efficiency through the dissemination of private information as it becomes public. I replicate Alchian's event study of capital market reactions to the Operation Castle series of nuclear detonations in the Marshall Islands, beginning with the Bravo shot on March 1, 1954 at Bikini Atoll which remains the largest nuclear detonation in US history, confirming Alchian's results. The Operation Castle tests pioneered the use of lithium deuteride dry fuel which paved the way for the development of high yield nuclear weapons deliverable by aircraft. I find significant upward movement in the price of Lithium Corp. relative to the other corporations and to DJIA in March 1954; within three weeks of Castle Bravo the stock was up 48\% before settling down to a monthly return of 28\% despite secrecy, scientific uncertainty, and public confusion surrounding the test; the company saw a return of 461\% for the year.},

Institutions trading large blocks have a larger optimal tick size than small retail investors,but both prefer a tick size strictly greater than zero. Second, a hybrid specialist/limit order market (like the NYSE) provides better liquidity to small retail and institutional trades, but a pure limit order market (like the Paris Bourse) may offer better liquidity on mid-size orders.},

At high frequency, changes in option prices can be predicted using recent changes in stock prices. A large proportion of option trades exploit this predictability to take liquidity at low cost, buying and selling immediately before option prices are expected to change. Conventional measures of effective spreads and price impact do not account for this execution timing but can be adjusted to do so. For the average trade, effective spreads that take account of trade timing ability are one-third smaller than the conventionally measured effective spreads; for trades that reflect execution timing, they are five times smaller. These findings have striking implications for the profitability of options trading strategies that involve taking liquidity. In addition, conventional measures of price impact overstate it by a factor of more than two. Our results also indicate that most option trades originate from investors who time executions, for example proprietary traders and institutional investors who have access to execution algorithms.},

A two-period dynamic model of equilibrium is used to demonstrate that rational investors use historical prices in forming their demands and to illustrate the sensitivity of the value of technical analysis to changes in the values of the exogenous parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the multi-asset pricing problem in the stock market with holding-based networks. We derive a linear noisy rational expectation equilibrium (LNREE) in the network, construct holding-based networks and test the LNREE{\textquoteright}s efficiency in generating predictive output validation. The results show that the LNREE fits the observed prices and returns of stocks quite well, especially for U.S. energy stocks. By changing the average risk aversion, the predictive performance of the model can be optimized. It provides a novel perspective for the empirical study on multi-asset pricing modeling.
In this study, we consider a one-period financial market with a dealer/broker and an infinite number of investors. While the dealer who trades on his own account (with proprietary trading) simultaneously sets both the transaction fee and the asset price, the broker who brings investors' orders to the market (with no proprietary trading) sets only the transaction fee, given that the price is determined according to the market-clearing condition among investors. We analyze the impact of proprietary trading on the asset price, transaction fee, trading volume, and the welfare of investors. We find that the bid and ask prices set by the dealer who can engage in proprietary trading are more favorable to average investors. As a result, both the trading volume and the transaction fee increase, and social welfare improves.
We analyze the evolution of governance-returns relationship in the last three decades and show that poor governance stocks outperform good governance ones after 2008. Previously, good governance stocks outperformed poor governance ones before this relationship disappeared in 2001. The novel reversal and reappearance of the relationship in 2008 can be explained by sophisticated investors learning to recognize governance risks and becoming more prudent after the global financial crisis. Our results show that investors could have identified via price and risk channels that the poorly governed firms face higher uncertainty regarding their future earnings power after 2008. Furthermore, following the crisis, we observe that institutional investors update their governance preferences through information-induced learning.
This paper relaxes the common assumption of the standard competitive noisy rational expectations framework that noise is one-dimensional. Within an environment characterized by multidimensional noise, I explore the strategic interactions between different traders that are informed about different components of the noise inherent in the market price. If noise is two-dimensional, several new types of complementarities in traders{\textquoteright} interactions arise that cannot be studied in the classical one-dimensional framework. The higher-dimensional case uncovers that higher dimensionality of noise mitigates the possibility of a market breakdown by weakening adverse selection. On the basis of the theoretical results, I discuss some predictions and implications concerning the effects of the increased usage of {\textquotedblleft}payment for order flow{\textquotedblright} in financial markets.
Do informed investors leave a trace in the market? This study shows that the portfolios composed of stocks with a high probability of informed trading (PIN) earn significantly higher returns under moving average strategies than a buy-and-hold strategy. The abnormal returns cannot be explained by a Fama-French five-factor model with an additional momentum factor or transaction costs and yet exists even after imposing delayed trades or controlling for firm size, volatility, and liquidity. Portfolios with alternative information asymmetry measures report similar albeit weaker results.
This paper presents a tractable model of asset price with informative trading volume. Investors condition demands on their rational expectations of both the equilibrium price and trading volume. We suggest a new information role of trading volume, which enables the investors to extract continuous information regarding the liquidation value volatility of the risky asset. The liquidation value volatility determines the relative importance of fundamental value and noise trading in the price function. It also monotonically increases the price volatility. We provide an explanation of the negative and nonlinear relationship between price volatility and trading volume. We also examine the effects of information accuracy and investor composition on the equilibrium price distribution and trading volume.},
