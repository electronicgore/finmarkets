%\section{Revision and readings}

\begin{frame}{Last time}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First look into LOB markets using \cite{glosten_is_1994} (continuous and discrete versions).
		\item Limit traders act in the same capacity as the dealer did before
		\begin{itemize}
			\item but face different incentives
			\item so act differently
			\item which leads to different market outcomes.
		\end{itemize}
		\item First dive into market design: tick sizes
		\begin{itemize}
			\item With discrete ticks, some competitive liqidity providers may get positive expected profits due to time priority
			\item Larger ticks $\to$ larger trading cost (direct effect)
			\item Larger ticks $\to$ higher average profit for LPs $\to$ more LPs attracted to the market $\to$ smaller trading cost (indirect effect; not modelled explicitly)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Today}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item (more) Market design:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What if we put a dealer in a LOB market?
			\item What about other priority rules for orders?
		\end{itemize}
		\item Dynamic analysis of LOB markets:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How do traders choose between limit and market orders?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}







\section{Market design}

\begin{frame}{Tick size and time priority}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}
		Suppose that there is no tick; quotes can  be placed in a continuous price space. Suppose that there is price priority. What is then the role of time priority, so that first-come quotes at identical prices are served first?
	\end{exampleblock}
	
	\only<handout:0>{
		\centering\pause
		\emph{``...The size of the trading increment is a
		powerful level that is underappreciated by
		regulators. The \alert{finer the trading increment},
		\structure{the more important price priority becomes
		relative to time priority}. In other words, if the
		market was designed to trade at continuous
		(vs discrete) non‚Äêpenny increments you could
		always win a trade by quoting the best price
		and the \structure{speed game would be non existent}''}

	}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}<handout:0>{Tick size and time priority}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The role of the tick is essentially \textit{to balance price priority and time priority}
		\item Larger tick gives more time priority, smaller tick gives more price priority
		\item When there is no tick, there is essentially no time priority...
		\item However, there is some evidence that ticks may arise \textit{endogenously}. In that case, time priority takes importance again
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Priority rules}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With \structure{pro-rata} allocation (limit orders at given tick executed proportionally to their size), as opposed to \alert{time priority}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The expected profit of all orders at price $A_k$ must be zero (as opposed to strictly positive)
			\item So execution probabilities must be lower for all orders
		\end{itemize}
		\item Lower profits lead to same dynamic consequences as with reducing tick size
		\item Pro-rata allocation rule used in the electronic futures markets for the leading short-term interest rate and for the two-year U.S. Treasuries.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Hybrid market}
	Hybrid market
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Suppose a dealer can compete with the limit order book, as follows
		\item The dealer may observe trade size $q$ before serving the order (and can fulfill the order before it is matched against LOB)
		\item Can profit by pricing at $\mathbb{E}[v|q=x]$ rather than an average of $\mathbb{E}[v|q \geq y]$ for $y \leq x$ which is used by the LOB
		\item Especially profitable on small trades
		\item But the existence of such a dealer invalidates our analysis of the LOB
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Profitable limit orders are being picked off
			\item So limit traders would gain negative profits if they follow the old strategy
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example 1 with hybrid market}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Example 1 from before continued. Assume an uninformed dealer receives order $q$. Can either send order to LOB or execute himself (at better price) 
		\pause
		\item Focus on ask side. Let $A^H_k$ be the hybrid ask price. When dealer observes $q=q_S$, he knows trader is noise trader and thus $\mathbb{E}[v|\structure{N}]=\mu$. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can execute order at just below $A^H_1$ and earn profit $A^H_1-\mu$.
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item Hence, only large orders $q=q_L$ are sent to LOB. LOB traders will expect this, and will price as if any order arriving to the LOB is large:
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbb{E}[v|q \ge q_S]=\mathbb{E}[v|q \ge q_L]=\mu+\frac{2\pi}{1+\pi} \sigma,
		\end{align*}
		and thus $A^H_1=A^H_2=\mu+\frac{2\pi}{1+\pi} \sigma$.
		\item $A^H_1>A_1$ and $A^H_2=A_2$: hybrid market less liquid than normal market
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Hybrid market: conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To be fair: adding a dealer to LOB market... 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item decreases liquidity in ``good times'', when there would've been a thick LOB
			\item but can help in bad times: if LOB is empty then adding a dealer has no adverse effects and will actually increase liquidity
			\item So in the end, adding a dealer is like a \structure{liquidity insurance} for the market
		\end{itemize}
		\item More analysis with risk-averse traders in \cite{viswanathan_market_2002}
		\item Also: the analysis of the example above relied on a bunch of implicit assumptions (which are not necessarily true):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item E.g., we assumed the market order revealed enough information. If MO-traders split their orders (e.g., trade one unit at a time), dealers no longer have any advantage. (\cite{back_working_2007})
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Market Design: conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Regulation aimed at improving market liquidity can backfire by distorting agents' incentives
		\item Shameless plug:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If you want to know more about market design, I teach a course on \structure{Mechanism Design} in Fall
			\item Explore how to design environments in which agents operate (i.e., distort their incentives) in order to generate desired behavior
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\section{Dynamic analysis: take or make liquidity}

\begin{frame}{Dynamic analysis}
	\begin{columns}
		\begin{column}{0.7\linewidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \cite{glosten_is_1994} shows how price schedule is formed under adverse selection
				\begin{itemize}
					\item But this analysis is \structure<1>{static} -- traders have no choice between limit/market orders = making/taking liquidity
				\end{itemize}
				\item Proper \structure<1>{dynamic} analysis is quite difficult
				\pause
				\item Choice between \alert{MO/LO} depends on:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \structure{Price differential} (=bid-ask spread)
					\pause
					\item \structure{Execution probability} of a limit order
					\begin{itemize}
						\item ...which depends on the current state of LOB
						\item But also on next trader's choice between MO/LO
						\item ...which depends on execution probability ...
					\end{itemize}
					\pause
					\item \structure{Adverse selection} faced by limit orders
					\begin{itemize}
						\item ...which depends on \emph{who} will trade against my limit order
						\item ...which depends on next trader's choice between market/limit order depending on their pvt info ...
					\end{itemize}
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{0.3\linewidth}
			\pause[2]
			\visible<handout:0>{
				\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{pics/thonk}
				\vspace{7em}
			}
		\end{column}
	\end{columns}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Literature}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We will look at a very simple model, loosely based on \cite{parlour_price_1998}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item fixed ask/bid prices, endogenous choice between MO and LO
		\end{itemize}
		\item Other models:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{foucault_order_1999}: choice of both quotes and order type; adds public info between periods (generating winner's curse for LOs: if your LO executes, it's because there was news that is unfavorable for you)
			\item \citet*{foucault_limit_2005}: model with heterogeneous discount factors; patient traders choose LO, impatient choose MO
			\item \cite{bhattacharya_limit_2020}: combine all of the above in a single tractable model
			\item Worth noting: limit orders are effectively free call/put options, so could be priced as such (\cite{copeland_information_1983})
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Model based on Parlour (1998)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Exogenous prices}. Bid and ask prices \alert{exogenously} given as $A>v>B$
		\item \textbf{Strategic traders}. One trader arrives per period (or as Poisson process) chooses btw limit or market order (one unit)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item LO valid one period, then automatically cancelled. Choice depends on prob. of LO being executed, i.e. `hit' by a MO from the next trader
			\item Valuation: $v+\alert{y}$. $y$ is uniformly distributed on $(-Y,Y)$, unobserved and independent across traders. $v$ is known and common to all.
			Note: book assumes a binary distr-n $y \in \{-Y,Y\}$.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Noise traders}. Numerous and patient. Always submit limit orders at $A$ (LSell) and/or $B$ (LBuy). Prioritised \emph{after} the strategic trader.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Profits}
	\begin{itemize}
		%if I want to sell, but there already is a LS in the book, then I still submit LS, because the other one will get cancelled before the next period
		\item Let $P^B_M (P^S_M)$ be the (endogenous) probability that the next trader submits a market buy (sell) order 
		\begin{align*}
			\text{Market sell: } & B-(v+y) \\
			\text{Limit sell: } & (A-v-y)P^B_M \\
			\text{Limit buy: } &(v+y-B)P^S_M \\
			\text{Market buy: } &v+y-A
		\end{align*}
		\item Limit order more attractive when more likely to execute: IRL (not in this model), this leads to automatic tendency for the limit order book to be replenished (resiliency)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Analysis}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Look for stationary eqm where  $A$, $B$, $P^B_M$, $P^S_M$ are constant 
		\item From the trader profits, we see that there must exist $\overline{y}$,  $\underline{y}$ and $\hat{y}$ such that the best response (optimal order) of the trader is
		\begin{equation*}
		BR=\left\{ \begin{aligned}
		&MSell		&& 	\text{ if } 	&&	-Y\le y \le \underline{y} \\
		&LSell 		&&	\text{ if } 	&&	\underline{y} \le y \le \hat{y} \\
		&LBuy		&&	\text{ if } 	&&	\hat{y} \le y \le \overline{y} \\
		&MBuy	&&	\text{ if } 	&&	\overline{y} \le y \le Y
		\end{aligned}
		\right.
		\end{equation*}
		NOTE: Traders with greater urgency/need to trade (extreme $y$) use market orders; 
		\\
		``patient'' traders use limit orders.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Equilibrium}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item From trader's BR:
		\begin{align*}
		P^S_M 	&=\mathbb{P}(-Y\le y \le \underline{y})=\frac{\underline{y}+Y}{2Y} \\
		P^B_M 	&=\mathbb{P}(\overline{y} \le y \le Y)=\frac{Y-\overline{y}}{2Y}
		\end{align*}
		\pause
		\item At $\underline{y}$, indifferent btw $MSell$ and $LSell$. At $\hat{y}$, indifferent btw $LSell$ and $LBuy$. At $\overline{y}$, indifferent btw $LBuy$ and $MBuy$. Thus:
		\begin{align}
		B-(v+\underline{y}) 					& = (A-v-\underline{y})\frac{Y-\overline{y}}{2Y} \label{eq1}\\
		(A-v-\hat{y}) \frac{Y-\overline{y}}{2Y} 			& = (v+\hat{y}-B)\frac{\underline{y}+Y}{2Y} \label{eq2}\\
		(v+\overline{y}-B) \frac{\underline{y}+Y}{2Y}  	& = v+\overline{y}-A \label{eq3}
		\end{align}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Equilibrium (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solving \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq3} we obtain the thresholds. 
		\\
		If we set $v=0$, $Y=2$, $A=1$ and $B=-1$ they become
		\begin{align*}
		\underline{y} 	& = \frac{1}{2}(3-\sqrt{33}) \simeq 1.4 \\
		\hat{y} 	& = 0 \\
		\overline{y} 		& = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{33}-3) \simeq -1.4 
		\end{align*}
		\item Thus, in equilibrium the probability of a market buy/sell order next period is $\frac{2-1.4}{2\cdot 2}=\frac{-1.4+2}{2 \cdot 2}=0.15$
		\item Given a large spread ($A-B=2$), limit order traders are willing to accept a low execution probability ($15\%$) in order to obtain better price
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[label=parlourmain]{Dynamic analysis: Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Trade occurs when seller and buyer meet and agree on terms
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Exchange brings sellers and buyers together
		\item Impatient traders search more actively (use market orders)
		\item Patient traders are more passive, offer liquidity (use limit orders)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ordinary traders can use limit orders:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to compete with market makers (and profit from providing liquidity as a self-contained liquidity)
		\item or to reduce their trading costs by accepting some non-execution risk. E.g., \citet*{frazzini_trading_2018}: avg trading cost of a large institutional trader is $\sim 0.015\%$ (a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than quoted spreads), arguably due to using LOs to minimize price impact.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Limit order book is dynamic: influence the choice of order
	\item In reality, many features to think about when placing orders
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\section{Dynamics and information}

\begin{frame}{Dynamics with adverse selection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Our analysis above focuses on non-execution risk, ignoring \structure{adverse selection}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can be due to privately informed investors picking off the limit orders
			\item or \alert{public news} arriving over time -- then all future traders are more informed!
		\end{itemize}
		\item The two can be combined in one model -- see \cite{foucault_order_1999} (also ch. 6.4.3 \& 6.6 of the textbook). Also: \hyperlink{adverse}{\beamerbutton{Want to know more?}}
		\item There is not too much interaction between the two, but there's an interesting dynamics of spread w.r.t. volatility of $\mu_t$ ($=v_t$ in the book)
		\item Read this at home.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Public information: issues and solutions}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item \textbf{Monitoring costs}: if limit traders do not monitor the news constantly, their orders will get picked off. Monitoring reduces adverse selection, but is costly.
		\item \textbf{Pegged limit orders}: tied to another security or another market, automatically repriced when that price changes. Another insurance device, available on selected exchanges.
		\item \textbf{Algorithmic trading}: allows to automatically monitor relevant variables and reprice limit orders as needed. But at the same time increases the speed at which orders can be picked off, so cuts both ways.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Informed limit trading?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item But of course, the best way to avoid being picked off is to be already informed.
		\item Foucault model only deals with public info -- there are no privately informed traders.
		\item But data shows that LOs are informative (\citet*{biais_empirical_1995,beber_order_2005,cao_information_2009})
		\item Even more: informed traders might be using more LOs than MOs (\cite{kaniel_so_2006})
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{LOB: conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A lot of stuff going on in LOBs, difficult to analyze, but we tried.
		\item See \cite{parlour_limit_2008} for a slightly more detailed review of literature on LOBs.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Exercise for next week}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solve exercise 5 after chapter 6 (page 235) in the textbook on the effect of fees charged for limit orders and market orders in Parlour model
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=adverse]{Dynamic model with adverse selection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Now, let us try to derive the time-$t$ prices $A_t$ and $B_t$ endogenously. 
		\item Suppose $v_t=v_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t \in \{-\sigma, \sigma \}$ with equal probability. $v_t$ is observed in period $t$. The period-$t$ trader has valuation $v_t+y_t$. 
		\item Again, we look for a stationary equilibrium. In particular:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Suppose that $A_t-v_{t-1}=v_{t-1}-B_t=S$ is constant.
			\item Suppose there exist $\underline{y}(\epsilon_t),\overline{y}(\epsilon_t),\hat{y}(\epsilon_t)$  that describe the trader's strategy in \textit{each} period  as a function of the value innovation $\epsilon_t$ 
			\item Thus there exist time-invariant $P^S_M$ and $P^B_M$ that characterize the probability of a next-period market sell/buy order 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Dynamic model with adverse selection (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We can write the equilibrium conditions as
		\begin{align*}
		B_t-(v_t+\underline{y}(\epsilon_t)) 					& = (A_{t+1}-\mathbb{E}_t[v_{t+1}|buy]-\underline{y}(\epsilon_t) 	)P^B_M \\
		(A_{t+1}-\mathbb{E}_t[v_{t+1}|buy]-\hat{y}(\epsilon_t))P^B_M 			& = (\mathbb{E}_t[v_{t+1}|sell]+\hat{y}(\epsilon_t)-B_{t+1})P^S_M  \\
		(\mathbb{E}_t[v_{t+1}|sell]+\overline{y}(\epsilon_t)-B_{t+1}) P^S_M  	& = v_t+\overline{y}(\epsilon_t)-A_t 
		\end{align*}
		\item Focus on the first and last equation. Use definition of $S$:
		\begin{align*}
		-S-\epsilon_t-\underline{y}(\epsilon_t) 					& = (S-\mathbb{E}_t[\epsilon_{t+1}|buy]-\underline{y}(\epsilon_t) 	)P^B_M \\
		(S+\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{t+1}|sell]+\overline{y}(\epsilon_t)) P^S_M  	& =-S+\epsilon_t+\overline{y}(\epsilon_t)
		\end{align*}
		\item Solve for $\underline{y}(\epsilon_t)$ and $\overline{y}(\epsilon_t)$. Determine $S$ from $A_t=\mathbb{E}_t[v_t|buy]$ and $B_t= \mathbb{E}_t[v_t|sell]$. Notice adv. sel. affects only limit orders. \hyperlink{parlourmain}{\beamerbutton{Back}}
